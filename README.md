# MKFTS

## The Milton Keynes Federation of Traditional Shotokan

This is a website designed for MKFTS, a fictional karate club. It is a site with three aims in mind: first, to advertise to visitors that the club exists and where/when it can be accessed; second, to encourage and motivate a visitor to begin taking karate classes, through text and images; and third, to give visitors a little information about Shotokan karate in general. The site is targeted primarily towards those new to the hobby, but would contain information that would be useful for existing practitioners as well. MKFTS's main use would be to advertise club times and locations - the most important information for anyone visiting.

The site is designed to work on three different screen sizes, including Desktop, Tablet and Phone sizes.

## Features
This site comprises four pages: a home page, an 'about' page, a 'clubs' page and a 'contact' page.

### Common Features
All four pages have the following features in common:

#### Header with Nav Bar
The header includes a text logo that is clickable, taking the user to the home page; and a menu with clickable links to all four pages. The curently-selected page is underlined, clearly indicating to the user where they are. This is identical across all four pages, and easily allows the user to navigate the website without becoming lost or using the 'back' button.

#### Hero Image
All four pages have a Hero image of identical size (with one small exception - see Contact for Desktop page). This image is consistent across three different screen sizes, although cropping may differ. This image also contains a box-out in blue that contains text in white, giving the full name of the site and also tying in to the key colour palette used throughout. These hero images have a gentle animation, easing in, to catch the eye and assure the user that the website is functioning.

#### Footer
All four pages have the same social-media links in grey, in a colour that is part of the key colour palette.
